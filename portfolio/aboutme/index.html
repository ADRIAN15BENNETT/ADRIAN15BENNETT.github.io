    </h2>
    <p1>
        My name is Adrian Bennett, I am fifteen years old, and I go to Chapel Hill High School. I swim, marvel, sing, act, and make friends! Another thing that you should know about me is that there is NO competition, and I am generally flawless!

            HERE IS SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION...
        </h3>
    <P2>
        I grew up in Douglasville, Georgia, at first on the eastern end. It was \called the Honey Hole, and there were lots of gangs, drugs, and other bad stuff that a three-year old child shouldn't be exposed to. SO...my mother moved onto Chapel Hill when I was about seven years old. Fast forward to now and here we are!

        <h4>
            THE FUTURE...
        </h4>
            <p>To start off, I am going to become a professional swimmer, and then swim in the Olympics. Also, let me just say that once I'm there, I am LITERALLY going to REDESIGN the world order that is professional swim records!</p>
                <img src="IMAGES/MEDALS%20(1).jpg" LENGTH="200" width="200">
             <p>After I show the world what is REALLY up wiht Olympic swimming, I will then go on to own one of the most SUCCESSFUL businesses in the world. Although the specifics of the business haven't necessarily been worked out yet, I do know some of the basics to it. And who knows, maybe YOU can bbecome one of the very people that I partner with to bring about the change in the world that promotes only the best qualities of the Earth, AND the people living in it!</p>
